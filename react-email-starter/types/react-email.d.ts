// The @react-email/components doesn't seem to provide TypeScript types.
// If you're not heavily relying on TypeScript for this particular module,
// you can declare it in a .d.ts file in your project to suppress the error. Create a new file in your project
// (for example react-email.d.ts), and add the following:
declare module "@react-email/components";
